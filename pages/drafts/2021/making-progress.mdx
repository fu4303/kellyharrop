## Intro

</VisuallyHidden>

Recently, our team finished up a major overhaul of various loading-based components within our design system. What started out as a simple task to implement design tokens, became a huge endeavor that helped our teams align on durable attributes. More importantly, it was a project that enabled design to become more in sync with development and vice versa.

This project touched on multiple aspects, including:

- Updating design libraries, specs, terminlogy and documentation for all products and platforms
- A new code approach to manage the updated specs and strategy around deprecating old versions
- Converting old styling to use newly generated design tokens
- Updated demos & configurable options
- Updated tests & implementation instructions
- Creating a comms strategy to inform the community of the changes
- A new process for design and code review

PHEW.

```js
function foo(bar) {
  var a = 42,
    b = 'Prism'
  return a + bar(b)
}
```
